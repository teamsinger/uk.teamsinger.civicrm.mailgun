3. Update [Mail Account settings](https://www.example.com/civicrm/admin/mailSettings?reset=1) adding the [Mailgun API key](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/203380100-Where-can-I-find-my-API-key-and-SMTP-credentials-) as the password and updating the protocol for MailgunDB for the account used for Bounce Processing.
4. Add webhook paths to [skip IDS checks](#user-content-skip-ids-checks)
5. [Configure Webhooks](https://documentation.mailgun.com/api-webhooks.html#webhooks) setting:

(Drupal)
 1. Dropped messages to https://www.example.com/civicrm/mailgun/drop
 2. Hard bounces to https://www.example.com/civicrm/mailgun/bounce

(Wordpress)
  1. Dropped messages to https://www.example.com/civicrm/civicrm/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/mailgun/drop&reset=1
  2. Hard bounces to https://www.example.com/civicrm/civicrm/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm/mailgun/bounce&reset=1

### Skip IDS Checks

When the webhooks are called these can trigger IDS checks in Civi. To get around this [CRM/Core/IDS.php](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/master/CRM/Core/IDS.php) has been patched to allow additional paths to be skipped. These paths need adding by adding the following to settings.php (Drupal) or wp-config.php (Wordpress)
```
define( 'CIVICRM_IDS_SKIP', serialize( array('civicrm/mailgun/drop', 'civicrm/mailgun/bounce') ) );
```
